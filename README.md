## What is this?

A **generic, customisable, living** GitHub Copilot instructions template. Drop it into any project — new or existing — and Copilot runs a structured one-time setup to tailor everything to your stack, team conventions, and preferences. From that point on, the instructions evolve with the project through a disciplined **Lean / Kaizen** loop.

This is not a linter config or a style guide. It is **instruction firmware** — a shared mental model between you and your AI coding agent about *how work should be done*.

---

## Quickstart

Open a Copilot chat in **any project** and say:

```text
Setup from asafelobotomy/copilot-instructions-template
```

Copilot fetches the template and setup guide directly from GitHub, interviews you with 5–22 questions (your choice of depth), fills every placeholder, scaffolds your workspace files, captures a Kaizen baseline, and self-destructs the setup script. **No cloning, no copying, no manual steps.**

> **⚠️ Use the Setup agent or an interactive model.** Codex models (`GPT-5.x-Codex`) run autonomously and cannot present interactive prompts — the preference interview will be silently skipped. Select **Claude Sonnet 4.6** (or any interactive model) in the Copilot picker, or use the `@setup` agent which pins the correct model automatically.

<!-- -->

> **Prefer to do it manually?** Copy `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and `SETUP.md` into your project, then tell Copilot: *"Please run the setup process described in SETUP.md."*
>
> **Starting fresh?** Click **Use this template** on GitHub, then run the quickstart above in your new repo.

## Key features

### ⚙️ Thirteen-section instructions architecture

`.github/copilot-instructions.md` ships with thirteen named sections (§1–§13) covering identity, workflow mode, safety gates, coding conventions, the PDCA cycle, waste cataloguing, self-editing protocol, test/extension review, project-specific overrides, a reusable tool library, a skill-based workflow system, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration. Every section is placeholder-driven — nothing is hardcoded to a particular stack.

### 🤖 Four model-pinned agents

`.github/agents/` contains four VS Code agent files (requires VS Code 1.106+), each pinned to the model best suited for its role:

| Agent | Model | Role |
|-------|-------|------|
| `setup.agent.md` | Claude Sonnet 4.6 | Onboarding, template ops, preference interview (batched with verification gate) |
| `coding.agent.md` | GPT-5.3-Codex | Implementation, refactoring, test writing |
| `review.agent.md` | Claude Opus 4.6 | Architectural review, Lean waste audit |
| `fast.agent.md` | Claude Haiku 4.5 | Quick lookups, explanations, small edits |

### 📚 Agent Skills library

Six starter skills are scaffolded into `.github/skills/` during setup, following the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) open standard. Skills are markdown-based behavioural instructions that teach the agent *how* to perform specific workflows — from authoring new skills to building MCP servers. Optionally search official and community skill repositories for proven workflows.

### 📂 Path-specific instructions

`.github/instructions/` contains context-aware instruction files with `applyTo:` glob patterns. When Copilot edits a file matching a pattern (e.g., test files, API routes, config files, documentation), the corresponding instructions are loaded alongside the main file. Four starter stubs are scaffolded during setup.

### 💬 Reusable prompt files (slash commands)

`.github/prompts/` contains five starter prompt files that become VS Code slash commands (`/explain`, `/refactor`, `/test-gen`, `/review-file`, `/commit-msg`). Each encapsulates a workflow grounded in the template's Lean methodology — waste-aware explanation, PDCA-driven refactoring, convention-following test generation, structured file review, and Conventional Commits.

### 🔒 Security hardening

All GitHub Actions are SHA-pinned to immutable commit hashes and protected with `step-security/harden-runner` for network egress monitoring. An OpenSSF Scorecard workflow runs weekly, uploading SARIF results to GitHub code scanning. A Graduated Trust Model in §10 assigns verification tiers (High / Standard / Guarded) to file paths, controlling how aggressively the agent seeks confirmation before making changes.

### 🔌 Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration

§13 governs how Copilot connects to external tools via MCP. During Expert setup, Copilot scaffolds `.vscode/mcp.json` with three tiers of servers: always-on (filesystem, memory, git), credentials-required (GitHub, fetch), and stack-specific (PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, AWS — auto-suggested from your dependencies). A quality gate ensures only verified, maintained servers are added.

### 🔄 Living update protocol

The template ships versioned. When a new version is released, say *"Update your instructions"* and Copilot will fetch the diff, present a section-by-section change manifest, let you apply / skip / customise each change, back up the current file, write the updates, and record everything in `JOURNAL.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`. The update is always reversible.

### 💓 Event-driven heartbeat

Copilot automatically runs health checks at natural breakpoints — session start, large refactors, dependency updates, and CI resolutions. The heartbeat reads `.copilot/workspace/HEARTBEAT.md`, checks dependency freshness, test coverage deltas, accumulated waste, memory consolidation, and settings drift. Alerts are reported only when something needs attention; healthy heartbeats are silent. The checklist is agent-writable — Copilot adds custom checks as it learns your project.

### 🏗️ Workspace identity system

Seven workspace files are scaffolded into your project during setup and maintained across sessions:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `IDENTITY.md` | Agent self-description and project context |
| `SOUL.md` | Values, reasoning patterns, and tone |
| `USER.md` | Your preferences, background, and working style |
| `TOOLS.md` | Tool usage patterns and VS Code extension registry |
| `MEMORY.md` | Session continuity and memory strategy |
| `BOOTSTRAP.md` | Permanent setup origin record |
| `HEARTBEAT.md` | Event-driven health check checklist |

### 📊 Kaizen baseline and metrics

At setup completion Copilot captures a baseline snapshot (file count, LOC, dependency count, test coverage) into `METRICS.md`. Every significant change appends a new row, giving you a continuous improvement record you can actually read.

### 🔍 Extension and test-coverage review

Two built-in review modes surface at the end of any session:

- **Extension Review** — audits your installed VS Code extensions against the project's needs, flags redundancies and gaps, and proposes a curated list.
- **Test Coverage Review** — categorises every module by test maturity, identifies untested critical paths, and recommends a prioritised CI/CD action plan.

## Philosophy

The Lean / Kaizen methodology this template encodes has three properties that make it well-suited to AI-assisted development:

1. **Measurable baselines** — you always know whether things are improving.
2. **Small batches** — changes are granular, reversible, and reviewable.
3. **Continuous improvement** — the instructions themselves are a product that gets better over time.

The instructions are not a one-time config. They are a living artefact that accumulates your team's hard-won conventions, retires rules that cause waste, and stays in sync with upstream improvements — automatically, with full audit trail.

---

## Reference implementation

[asafelobotomy/Valis](examples/valis/README.md) is the canonical first consumer of this template — a CLI AI assistant with a mature Lean/Kaizen workflow that this template was distilled from.
