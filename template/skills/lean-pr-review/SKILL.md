# Lean PR Review

Perform a structured pull request review using §2 Review Mode conventions and §6 waste categories.

## When to use

- The user asks to "review this PR", "review these changes", or "check my diff"
- The Review agent hands off a PR-scoped review task
- A pull request needs a quality gate before merge

## When NOT to use

- The user wants a full architectural review (use Review Mode directly with the full codebase)
- The changes are a single-line typo fix (overkill — just approve)

## Steps

1. **Get the diff** — Read the PR diff or the set of changed files. If working locally, use `git diff main...HEAD` or the equivalent for the target branch.

2. **Scan each changed file** — For every file in the diff, read the full file (not just the diff hunk) to understand context.

3. **Classify each finding** — For every issue found, record:

   ```text
   [severity] | [file:line] | [waste category] | [description]
   ```

   Severity levels:
   - `critical` — blocks merge; security flaw, data loss risk, or broken functionality
   - `major` — should fix before merge; logic error, missing test, or significant smell
   - `minor` — nice to fix; style issue, naming, minor inefficiency
   - `advisory` — informational; suggestion for future improvement

   Waste categories (§6):
   - W1 Overproduction · W2 Waiting · W3 Transport · W4 Over-processing
   - W5 Inventory · W6 Motion · W7 Defects · W8 Unused talent

4. **Check test coverage** — Verify that new or changed behaviour has corresponding tests. Flag untested paths as `major | W7 Defects`.

5. **Check for baseline breaches** — Compare against §3 baselines:
   - File LOC limits (warn / hard)
   - Dependency budget (if deps were added)
   - Type errors (must be zero)

6. **Produce the report** — Format as:

   ```markdown
   ## PR Review — <PR title or branch name>

   ### Summary
   <1–2 sentence overview of the changes and their quality>

   ### Findings (<N> total: <critical> critical, <major> major, <minor> minor, <advisory> advisory)

   #### Critical
   - [critical] | [file:line] | [W7] | <description>

   #### Major
   - [major] | [file:line] | [W4] | <description>

   #### Minor
   - [minor] | [file:line] | [W1] | <description>

   #### Advisory
   - [advisory] | [file:line] | [W8] | <description>

   ### Verdict
   <APPROVE / REQUEST CHANGES / COMMENT>
   ```

7. **Wait** — Do not apply fixes. Present the report and wait for the user to decide what to address.

## Verify

- [ ] Every finding has all four fields: severity, file:line, waste category, description
- [ ] Critical findings are genuinely blocking (not inflated)
- [ ] Test coverage was checked for all new behaviour
- [ ] Baseline breaches are flagged
- [ ] Report ends with a clear verdict
