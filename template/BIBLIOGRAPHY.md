# Bibliography — {{PROJECT_NAME}}

Every file in the project is catalogued here. Update this file whenever a file is created, renamed, deleted, or its purpose changes.

Maintenance rule: run `{{LOC_COMMAND}}` and compare outputs to this table. Any file present in the codebase but absent from this table is **undocumented inventory** (Waste Category 5).
