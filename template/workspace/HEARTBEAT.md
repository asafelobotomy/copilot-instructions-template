# Heartbeat — {{PROJECT_NAME}}

> Event-driven health check. Read this file at every trigger event, run all checks, update Pulse, and log to History.
> **Contract**: Follow this checklist strictly. Do not infer tasks from prior sessions.

## Pulse

`HEARTBEAT_OK` — No alerts.

## Event Triggers

Fire a heartbeat when any of these occur:

- **Session start** — always
- **Large change** — modified >5 files in a single task
- **Refactor/migration** — task tagged as refactor, migration, or restructure
- **Dependency update** — any manifest changed (package.json, Cargo.toml, requirements.txt, go.mod, etc.)
- **CI resolution** — after resolving a CI failure
- **Explicit** — user says "Check your heartbeat"
<!-- Add custom triggers below this line -->

## Checks

Run each check; prepend `[!]` to Pulse if any fails:

- [ ] **Dependency audit** — any outdated or security-advisory deps in TOOLS.md / manifests?
- [ ] **Test coverage delta** — did coverage drop since last METRICS.md row?
- [ ] **Waste scan** — any new W1–W16 waste accumulated this session? (§6)
- [ ] **MEMORY.md consolidation** — anything from this session to persist?
- [ ] **METRICS.md freshness** — baseline older than 3 sessions?
- [ ] **Settings drift** — do §10 overrides still match the codebase?
