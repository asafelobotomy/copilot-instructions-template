# Documentation File Instructions

- Write for a reader who has never seen this project before.
- Use active voice and present tense.
- Keep sentences short — one idea per sentence.
- Use code fences with language hints for all code examples.
- Section headings should describe actions or outcomes, not vague topics.
- Link to related files using relative paths rather than duplicating content.
- Ensure all links resolve to real files — dead links erode trust.
